# Compound_Interest
Calculate compound interest 

The terms in the formula are:

A is the amount of money in the account after the specified number of years.

P is the principal amount that was originally deposited into the account.

r is the annual interest rate.

n is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded.

t is the specified number of years.

Write a program that makes the calculation for you. 
The program should ask the user to input the following:

The amount of principal originally deposited into the account
The annual interest rate paid by the account
The number of times per year that the interest is compounded 
(For example, if interest is compounded monthly, enter 12. If interest is compounded quarterly, enter 4.)
The number of years the account will be left to earn interest
Once the input data has been entered, the program should calculate and display 
the amount of money that will be in the account after the specified number of years.
